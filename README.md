# Misk Mobility Intelligence System (MMIS)

MMIS is a concept showcase site for an AI-powered mobility platform that unifies wayfinding, traffic orchestration, and intelligent crowd management across Misk City. The page highlights the problem space, core solution pillars, market opportunity, and revenue strategy in a single scannable presentation.

## Preview

The site is a static HTML/CSS/JS experience. Open `index.html` directly in a browser or serve it locally:

```bash
cd /workspace/MMIS  # adjust if cloned elsewhere
python3 -m http.server 8080
```

Then browse to <http://localhost:8080>.

## Structure

- `index.html` – semantic sections covering problem, solution, market, business model, and impact.
- `styles.css` – modern dark-theme visual system with responsive layouts.
- `script.js` – light enhancements for metric animations, sticky navigation highlighting, and dynamic footer year.

## Customization

Update copy inside `index.html` to tailor messaging, or extend `styles.css` for branding tweaks (colors, typography). Animations can be modified in `script.js`.

## License

See `LICENSE` for details.
